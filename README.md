## Title

Find My Fare
​
## Application Description
​
Our application will allow hungry customers to search for and find food truck fare by either cuisine, location, or food truck name. The application will also allow food truck owners to input their personal food truck data (food truck name, cuisine, and location) so they can be found by hungry customers as well.

## Usage
Log into our system by providing your username and password. An account will have to be created if the user has not previously created one. Once in our system, the user can look up food trucks by name, location, or cuisine type. The search results are then mapped with markers on a live google map. In addition to viewing all the food trucks in our database, members can add new food trucks.
